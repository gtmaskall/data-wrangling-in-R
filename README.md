# Introduction

Data wrangling is important. Data come to us in a variety of weird and wonderful formats, for sure.
We usually don't have the luxury that our data were generated by us to our own specification.
Fitting a model, and refining it are the easy bits. Bashing the data into a shape that has
just the features you want in just the right format is a key skill.

For a while I used plyr and I thought it was great being able to take a list and turn it
into a data frame. But plyr is no longer being developed. The package to look at for much of
that functionality is purrr. That and tidyr will do much for you.

I thought I'd start this repository as part self-study documentation 
(I'm pretty new to purrr, after all), and part tutorial.
